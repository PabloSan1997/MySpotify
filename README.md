# MySpotify

## Description

This project is a basic Spotify clone created for educational purposes. The app displays different categories, albums, and songs. Users can browse and listen to their favorite tracks hosted on the server. They also have the option to search for any category or album.
All data (excluding files) is stored on postgres, while image and audio files are stored in [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/ "https://firebase.google.com").
There are also users with `ADMIN` role, who have permissions to delete and update songs, albums and categories. They are responsible to upload images and audio files to the app.
